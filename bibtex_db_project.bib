  abstract = {The Information-Centric Networking (ICN) paradigm is expected to be
	one of the major innovation of the Future Internet An ICN can be
	characterized by some key components like: (i) the content-centric
	request/reply paradigm for data distribution, (ii) route-by-name
	operations, and (iii) in-network caching. In this paper we focus
	on a framework for ICN called CONET (COntent NETwork) and in particular
	on a solution devised under this framework called coCONET. coCONET
	characteristics make it suitable for deployment in accordance to
	the Software Defined Networks (SDN) philosophy. In this paper, we
	will describe how coCONET can be implemented over an OpenFlow (the
	most popular SDN instantiation, to date) network and how OpenFlow
	should be modified to better suit the operations of coCONET and,
	more in general, of ICN solutions.},
