	one of the major innovation of the Future Internet An ICN can be
	characterized by some key components like: (i) the content-centric
	request/reply paradigm for data distribution, (ii) route-by-name
	operations, and (iii) in-network caching. In this paper we focus
	on a framework for ICN called CONET (COntent NETwork) and in particular
	on a solution devised under this framework called coCONET. coCONET
	characteristics make it suitable for deployment in accordance to
	the Software Defined Networks (SDN) philosophy. In this paper, we
	will describe how coCONET can be implemented over an OpenFlow (the
	most popular SDN instantiation, to date) network and how OpenFlow
	should be modified to better suit the operations of coCONET and,
	more in general, of ICN solutions.},

  abstract = {The idea of programmable networks has recently regained considerable
	momentum due to the emergence of the
	
	Software-Deﬁned Networking (SDN) paradigm. SDN, often referred to
	as a “radical new idea in networking”, promises to dramatically simplify
	network management and enable innovation
	
	through network programmability. This paper surveys the stateof-the-art
	in programmable networks with an emphasis on SDN.
	
	We provide a historic perspective of programmable networks
	
	from early ideas to recent developments. Then we present the
	
	SDN architecture and the OpenFlow standard in particular,
	
	discuss current alternatives for implementation and testing SDNbased
	protocols and services, examine current and future SDN

  title = {The Case for Reliable Software Transactional Networking},
  journal = {arXiv preprint arXiv:1305.7429},
  year = {2013},
  abstract = {Software-defined networking (SDN) is a novel paradigm that out-sources
	the control of packet-forwarding switches to a set of software controllers.
	The most fundamental task of these controllers is the correct implementation
	of the network policy, i.e., the intended network behavior. In essence,
	such a policy specifies the rules by which packets must be forwarded
	across the network. This paper initiates the study of the SDN control
	plane as a distributed system. 
	
	We introduce a formal model describing the interaction between the
	data plane and a distributed control plane (consisting of a collection
	of fault-prone controllers). Then we formulate the problem of consistent
	composition of concurrent network policy updates. The composition
	is enabled via a transactional interface with all-or-nothing semantics.
	The system behaves as though committed updates are installed atomically
	and every data packet traverses the network instantaneously, respecting
	a sequential composition of previously installed committed updates.
	Updates that cannot be composed are aborted and do not affect the
	data plane. 
	
	We show that in the asynchronous environment, it is impossible to
	achieve consistent policy composition that tolerates a single controller
	crash. We then discuss stronger variants of the model that allow
	for solving the problem and study algorithmic complexities of such
	solutions.},
